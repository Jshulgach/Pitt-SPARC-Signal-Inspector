<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
The University of Pittsburgh SPARC Signal Inspector is a Matlab-based desktop software application intended to assist in the dynamic searching and evaluation of physiological signals. Signal Inspector is designed with a friendly GUI to streamline the data analyis process and integrate into your processing pipeline for [SPARC](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) investigators. Signal Inspector has been tested on versions of Matlab 2018 and newer, and Octave supported is expected in the near future.


## Prerequisites
The application depends on the following packages installed with your Matlab/Octave license:
 - [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) (Required)
 - [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) (Optional) 

## Installation
For Mac and Linux OS, Download the .mlappinstall file using a git terminal into the specified directory:

    cd ~/path/to/folder
    git clone
    
If you prefer to download the file from the github repo without using git:
* Go to the file you want to download.
* Click it to view the contents within the GitHub UI.
* In the top right, right click the Raw button.
Save as...


Pitt SPARC Signal Inspector is distributed as an App which can be easily installed through the use of Matlab's App installer.


All our releases are accessible in the [releases tab](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/releases). Latest version: 1.0.0

Although we would highly encourage you to use SODA for the entire organization and submission process of your dataset, SODA is designed such that you are not bound to using the software for all of the steps: you can perform desired steps from SODA and others outside. 

## Issues and feedback
To report any issues found, suggest improvements, or request a new feature, please open a new issue via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Jshulgach/Pitt-SPARC-Signal-Inspector/issues).

## Using the Source Code

If you want to modify SODA to better suit your needs or compile it for an operating system not mentioned above, please follow the instructions provided in the [developer guidelines](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Using-the-Source-Code) of our documentation.
