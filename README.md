<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

The University of Pittsburgh SPARC Signal Inspector is a Matlab-based desktop software application intended to assist in the dynamic searching and evaluation of physiological signals. A cSignal Inspector is designed with a user friendly interface to streamline the data analyis process and integrate into your processing pipeline for [SPARC](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) investigators.

SODA is designed such that users can accomplish all the [requirements to submit a SPARC dataset](https://docs.sparc.science/submit_data.html) rapidly through a single interface. Moreover, requirements have been broken down into easy-to-perform steps and automation has been integrated to reduce users' effort to a bare minimum during each step, often to just a few clicks.

<!-- [Click Here](https://3dtholdings-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/bpatel_calmi2_org/EQLHAKyyfaZJoDMYDYIwHIQB_jBZWh8mxBE5rRW-g_Oo5w?e=7wLGLI) (Developed & tested on Ubuntu Desktop 18.04) -->

All our releases are accessible in the [releases tab](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/releases). Latest version: 1.0.0

#### Important: the [Blackfynn agent](https://developer.blackfynn.io/agent/index.html) must be installed to upload datasets to Blackfynn through SODA.

<!--Example datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://3dtholdings-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/bpatel_calmi2_org/Eig4sjUjchRCiUtfpeH-ydYBjvql_KYW0ZSE9_Td6bPzrQ?e=ApSOvh). -->
Please follow the instructions given in [our documentation](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/wiki/Download) if you need help with installing/uninstalling SODA. The software may work on older operating system versions than those specified above but no testing has been done on those platforms. 


## Using SODA
Click on the image below and watch our video to quickly familiarize yourself with the user interface of SODA:

</a>
</p>

We also suggest watching our tutorial video to learn how to easily organize and submit your SPARC dataset with SODA in 8 steps:

</a>
</p>

Although we would highly encourage you to use SODA for the entire organization and submission process of your dataset, SODA is designed such that you are not bound to using the software for all of the steps: you can perform desired steps from SODA and others outside. 

## Issues and feedback
To report any issues with the software, suggest improvements, or request a new feature, please open a new issue via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/issues). Provide adequate information (operating system, steps leading to error, screenshots) so we can help you efficiently. Alternatively, you could also use [our feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyUw2_NI1-2tlAr8oB5_JcJ_yjTB-zUDt9skfGjNU9qjITwg/viewform?ts=5e433bea). The feedback form is also accessible directly in the user interface of SODA.
