<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
The University of Pittsburgh SPARC Signal Inspector is a Matlab-based desktop software application intended to assist in the dynamic searching and evaluation of physiological signals. Signal Inspector is designed with a friendly GUI to streamline the data analyis process and integrate into your processing pipeline for [SPARC](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) investigators. Signal Inspector has been tested on versions of Matlab 2018 and newer.


## Prerequisites
The application depends on the following packages installed with your Matlab license:
 - [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) (Required)
 - [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) (Optional) 

## Installation

1. (Windows) Download the repo files (click "Clone or download" and select "Download ZIP")
       OR
   (Mac/Linux) Open a terminal and use git to clone the repo into the specified directory:

        cd ~/path/to/folder
        git clone https://github.com/Jshulgach/Pitt-SPARC-Signal-Inspector
    

2. Pitt SPARC Signal Inspector is distributed as an App which can be easily installed through the use of Matlab's App installer. Open the Matlab UI, click on the "Apps" tab, select "Install App", and navigate to file directory.

All our releases are accessible in the [releases tab](https://github.com/bvhpatel/SODA/releases). Latest version: 1.0.0

Although we would highly encourage you to use SODA for the entire organization and submission process of your dataset, SODA is designed such that you are not bound to using the software for all of the steps: you can perform desired steps from SODA and others outside. 

## Issues and feedback
To report any issues found, suggest improvements, or request a new feature, please open a new issue via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Jshulgach/Pitt-SPARC-Signal-Inspector/issues).
